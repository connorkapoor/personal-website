# Personal Website

This is my personal website, built with simplicity and content focus in mind.

## Features

- **Clean Design**: Minimal, text-focused design with white background and black text
- **Markdown CMS**: Easy content management using markdown files
- **Responsive**: Works well on all device sizes
- **Fast**: Built with Next.js for optimal performance
- **Static Generation**: All pages are statically generated for fast loading

## Technical Details

The website is built using:

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Gray Matter** for parsing markdown frontmatter
- **Remark** for converting markdown to HTML

## Content Management

Adding new content is as simple as creating markdown files:

- Blog posts go in `content/blog/`
- Projects go in `content/projects/`

Each file includes frontmatter with metadata and the content in markdown format.

## Deployment

The site is designed to be deployed on Vercel with zero configuration required.
